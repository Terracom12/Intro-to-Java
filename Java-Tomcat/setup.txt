The first thing that you have to do is download the zip file from: http://apache.mirrors.lucidnetworks.net/tomcat/tomcat-7/v7.0.91/bin/apache-tomcat-7.0.91-windows-x64.zip

Then you have to extract the files to C:\tomcat

Then you have to go to your enviornment variables, and create a new one called JAVA_HOME with the value of your jdk directory.

Finally you have to copy your servlet-api.jar (from tomcat/lib) and copy it to #JRE_LOCATION#\lib\ext\
